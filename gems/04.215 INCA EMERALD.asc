F This is a pretty traditonal antique looking emerald cut. I had a particular project for some stones 
F like this cut in emeralds which were a little dark. However, these angles will work well for such a 
F stone. Computed average brilliance for emerald. ISO= 71.3% COS= 56.7% DELTA=14.6% Dispersion= 13.1% 
F Scintillation= 32.8%. You can also use this design for RI>1.58 with no angle changes.
