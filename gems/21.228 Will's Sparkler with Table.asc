F This gives a stone with lots of color and flash.  You decide the size of table.  Do not get it very large.
F You decide if you want P2 to go to girdle.  You get good flass either way.
F You decide how deep to cut C3 into C1 & C2.  It will be correct if you do not chenge height for C2,
F change angle and index and cut to hard stop to get C3.  Beautiful error.
