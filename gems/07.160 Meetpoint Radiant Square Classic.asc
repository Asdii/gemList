F Some people claim that step-facet designs are not meetpoint designs and are
F therefore not reproducible. I find such statements a bit puzzling because
F most, if not all, such designs can be created using a meetpoint sequence by
F cutting temporary facets, as shown by PF3 in the cutting sequence for this design.
