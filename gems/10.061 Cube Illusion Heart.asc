F Sid Word was the master of the checkerboard. He discovered that what he
F termed a "mono" pavilion was all that was needed with a checker crown. I
F began with my Cube Illusion Triangle 13.110, rounded off two corners and
F added a flat-side girdle facet, which is not level. Angles OK for any RI.
